# Reinstall pyenv virtualenv

A very specific script to reinstall pyenv virtual envs.

Can be used for pyenv virtual envs created with the version number in the virtual env name:

    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.17 my_project_name__3.9.17

Use at your own risk. This script does not install python dependencies after a virtual env
has been re-created.
